title: About me

Hi, I'm Len. I am a PhD student at Ghent University. In this blog, I try to bring my research to a somewhat broader audience, with figures, videos and animations that I cannot put into a paper.

## Interests

My main research interests include:

- Creative applications using deep learning (e.g. music synthesis), particularly with applications for electronic dance music,
- Music information retrieval and music processing,
- Unsupervised deep learning, representation learning.

Additionally, I am an active volunteer in the <a href="http://www.iaeste.be">IAESTE</a> organization, where I try to help building a world with more international collaboration and understanding between people and cultures.
