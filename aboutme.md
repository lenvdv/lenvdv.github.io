Hi, I'm Len. I am a PhD student at Ghent University, doing research on unsupervised, run-time adaptive deep learning for multimodal sensor data. In this blog, I try to bring my research to a somewhat broader audience, with animations, figures and videos that I cannot put into a paper.

## Interests

My main research interests include:

- Unsupervised deep learning
- Representation learning
- Network plasticity and adaptivity
- Multimodal deep learning

I am also interested in music information retrieval and music processing (I did my [master's thesis](/2018-03-20-autodj/) on that), but I'm currently not doing any research on that topic.

Additionally, I am an active volunteer in the <a href="http://www.iaeste.be">IAESTE</a> organization, where I try to help building a world with more international collaboration and understanding between people and cultures.
